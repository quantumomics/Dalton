## RCB for D<sub><sup>alton</sup></sub><sup>®</sup>
RCB is a Reaction Circuit Board, for the <b>D<sub><sup>alton</sup></sub><sup>®</sup></b>, where the reaction of the sequencing can be carried out by weight based sequencing method. RCB, is a four layers of Mylar, (a form of polyester resin used to make heat-resistant plastic films and sheets. It is made by copolymerizing ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid) created for the house of nucleic acids, where the state of the art designed — <b>bond energy sensor</b>, named <b>δ</b> sensor is incorporated to know the weight of that.
