## RCB for D<sub><sup>alton</sup></sub><sup>®</sup>
RCB or Reaction Circuit Board, for the <b>D<sub><sup>alton</sup></sub><sup>®</sup></b>, where the reaction of the sequencing can be carried out by weight based sequencing method. RCB, is a four layers of Mylar (a form of polyester resin used to make heat-resistant plastic films and sheets. It is made by copolymerizing ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid.) created for the house of nucleic acids, where the state of the art designed — <b>bond energy sensor</b>, named <b>δ sensor</b> is incorporated to know the weight of that. The <b>δ sensor</b> is 5-pin nanoelectronics device developed by the great nanoelectronics engineering scientists and with the idea and concept originated from Department of Chemistry, Wayne State University and Illumina, Inc. — participated with fourteen young minds from physical chemistry and instrumentations. The δ sensor is giving the weight information in the form of the <b>weight gram</b>, and it have signal(s) respect to A/T/G/C/U for nucleic acids and ... for proteins. To process the outcome of the signal(s), a factory fitted electronics incorporated, named weight signals processors or <b>ε</b>.

## Signome
Signome is an electronics device that is reading the input signals from the <b>ε</b>, and counting, assembling, doing the noise reduction, and writing the sequence outputs into the <b>KSN.1</b> file format.

## Allome
Allome is an electronics device, the master QPU (Quantum Processing Unit — the invented MPRT microelectronics, named <b>μ</b> design methodology.) fabricated with approximately 1.9 trillion transistors and speed up to 9.9 GHz.
